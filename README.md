# Soil-monitoring-bot-
This repository contains all the work(till task 5) of Soil Monitoring Bot theme(eYRC-2021-22). In this theme a Soil Monitoring bot was build to be deployed on an arena which is an abstraction of actual agricultural field. The brain of the bot was powered by an FPGA board that controls its sensors, actuators and pick-place mechanism.
