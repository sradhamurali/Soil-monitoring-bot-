# Soil-monitoring-bot-
This repository contains all the work(till task 5) of Soil Monitoring Bot theme(eYRC-2021-22). In this theme a Soil Monitoring bot was build to be deployed on an arena which is an abstraction of actual agricultural field. The brain of the bot was powered by an FPGA board that controls its sensors, actuators and pick-place mechanism.
# Hardware Used
De0-Nano board
600 rpm N20 motors
L9110s Motor Driver
2S Li-ion battery
Xbee s2c module
TCS3200 Color sensor
Level shifter
Potentiometer
Electromagnet
LEDs
# Learnings
Building the Soil Monitoring Bot from scratch,Pick-place mechanism using electromagnet,Wired and Wireless communication using XBEE,3 channel ADC controller for fetching 12-bit digital value of analog signal from on-board ADC128S022,Interfaced TCS3200 colour sensor with De0 nano FPGA board to detect RGB colours,PID control algorithm to control the movement of the bot,Motor speed variation using PWM,Learnt Path Planning Algorithms.
